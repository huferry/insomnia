# insomnia
Turn your computer to be insomnia, so it will not go into sleep mode or activate the screen saver.

## Usage
This is a sketch for a Digispark [ATTiny85](https://digistump.com/wiki/digispark) microcontroller. You should be able to buy one from [AliExpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20210116022138&SearchText=digispark+attiny85).

When you upload the sketch on the board, it will act as a mouse that will inject a small mouse move every 10 seconds preventing computer going into sleep mode.
